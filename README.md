# Furuta Pendulum Control

The Furuta pendulum, also known as the rotational inverted pendulum, is a type of inverted pendulum system that involves a pendulum mounted on a rotating base. The dynamics of the Furuta pendulum are nonlinear, making it an interesting subject for research and control system development.

Therefore, this project focuses on developing a strategy for controlling the Furuta pendulum.
Mainly, the inverted pendulum can be controlled by an agent when applying a reinforcement learning methodology from an initial steady-state.
